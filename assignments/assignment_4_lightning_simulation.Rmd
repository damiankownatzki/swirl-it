# Task

- Create a random lightning algorithm, and visualize the result!
- The lightning should be a random walk from top to bottom.
- At each step, there is a 1% chance of forking.
- Each fork in itself is a new random walk.
- The forks do not need to fork further.
- Visualize the lightning, preferably using black background and blue/white foreground color. 
- Try to do this using no loops!

# Dataset

There is no dataset for this project. You have to simulate from scratch!

```{r}
