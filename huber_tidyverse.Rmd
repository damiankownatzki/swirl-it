This lesson should help you to understand why the 'tidyverse' world is interesting. Working with R is easier with tidyverse! 

The tidyverse is an collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 

Developed by RStudio's chief scientist Hadley Wickham, tidyverse provides an efficient, fast, and well-documented workflow for general data modeling, wrangling, and visualization tasks.
